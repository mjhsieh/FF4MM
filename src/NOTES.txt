jkh notes:
We first discuss a closed system for which the number of particles N,
the volume V, and the total energy E are fixed. We also assume that 
the system is isolated, i.e., that the influence of external parameters
such as gravitational and magnetic fields can be ignored. A system with
constant number of particles, constant volume and constant energy is 
called a microcanonical ensemble.

mjhsieh notes:
   E0 = ½ mv^2 + V(r) is conserved
   dE0/dt = ½ m 2 v a + dV/dt
      =>   m v a + dV/dr dr/dt = m v a - F v
         = m v a - m a v = 0
      => conserved (since F = - dV/dr, = m*a )
